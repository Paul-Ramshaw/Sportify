# Sportify

The aim of Sportify is to help increase inclusivity in sport.  The platform lets users find and book onto local sporting events.  It also allows users to view information about the event host, including a rating of the host.  The user can also host their own events.  


## Seeding the test database

The Sportify-Firebase-admmin can be used to seed the database with sample data.
